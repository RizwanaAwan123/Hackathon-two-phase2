[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are requested
# to run after the completion of a migration file.
#
# Format: key = operation, value = arguments
#
# Operations:
#   execute = execute the arguments using subprocess.run()
#       arguments are space-separated, with the first being the command
#       and the rest as positional arguments to that command
#
#   python = execute the arguments as a Python function
#       arguments are space-separated, with the first being the function name
#       and the rest as string arguments to that function
#
# When specifying arguments, Python backslashes can be used to escape space
# characters, but otherwise arguments are split on spaces.
#
# Examples:
#   hooks = black, isort
#   black.type = exec
#   black.exec = black --exclude alembic/ %(file)s
#   isort.type = exec
#   isort.exec = isort %(file)s
#
# hooks = black
# black.type = exec
# black.exec = black %(file)s
